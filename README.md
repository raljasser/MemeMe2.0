# MemeMe 2.0: The Final Product

_Third project - iOS Developer Nanodegree Program (Udacity)_

## Project Overview

Students have created an app that enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme, and share that meme on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email. In this project, sent memes will appear in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and a collection view.

## What will I learn?

You will learn how to:

* Set up a navigation structure that creates an intuitive flow through the app
* Build tables with datasources and delegates
* Create custom table view cells
* Implement user interfaces with tab views and collection views
